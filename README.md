# room-monitoring-system

We were looking for a system which we could use to monitor a room. We only wanted to monitor five things, humidity, temparature, luminosity, number of people in the room and carbon dioxide levels. 
The humidity and temparature will help us determine the comfortability of the room, luminosity will help us determine whether all lights are working as expected and if one of them dies we will know to replace it immediately.
Knowing the number of people in the room will help us make sure the room is not filled past its capacity. Knowing the CO2 levels will help us in improving the air quality by improving ventilation.
